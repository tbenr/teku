## Upcoming Breaking Changes

- Upgrading the minimum Java version to Java 17, which means users will need to upgrade their Java installation to at least `Java 17`.  The docker versions relying on `jdk16` will no longer be published, so docker users explicitly referencing the `jdk16` build need to update their package to reference `jdk17`, as tags `develop-jdk16`, `develop-jdk16-arm64`, `latest-jdk16` will no longer be updated.
