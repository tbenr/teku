### Breaking Changes

### Additions and Improvements
 - Added experimental gossipsub metrics `libp2p_gossip_gossipsub_*` (off by default; enable them on top of the default metric categories with `--Xmetrics-additional-categories=LIBP2P_GOSSIP`).

### Bug Fixes
 - The ENR `eth2` field now advertises the current fork version as `next_fork_version` when a BPO fork is scheduled before the next hard fork, as the Fulu p2p specification requires.
 - A block production request that fails no longer keeps its preparation for the slot, so a retry within the same slot starts from a fresh preparation.
