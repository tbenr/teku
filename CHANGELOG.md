### Breaking Changes

### Additions and Improvements
 - Added gossipsub metrics `libp2p_gossip_gossipsub_*` (off by default; enable them with `--Xmetrics-additional-categories=LIBP2P_GOSSIP`).
 - Block production now resends `forkchoiceUpdated` when the execution layer returned no `payloadId` (e.g. `SYNCING`) for the one sent ahead of the proposal slot, instead of missing the proposal. A warning is logged when no `payloadId` is returned.

### Bug Fixes
 - The validator client now sends the required `Eth-Consensus-Version` header when submitting gloas proposer preferences to the beacon node.
 - The ENR `eth2` field now advertises the current fork version as `next_fork_version` when a BPO fork is scheduled before the next hard fork, as the Fulu p2p specification requires.
 - A block production request that fails no longer keeps its preparation for the slot, so a retry within the same slot starts from a fresh preparation.
 - Fixed valid voluntary exits and slashings referring to an earlier fork being rejected on gossip, which wrongly penalised the peers forwarding them.
